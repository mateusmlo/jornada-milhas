### ‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS
Some things may not be working as intended or just not working at all, I'm doing my best ü•≤

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My entry to the 7th edition of Alura's back-end challenge, which consists of an API from a travel agency where users can search for possible travel locations, write reviews and attach pictures. For this project I decided to use my second language, which is Go! It has been very fun and indeed challenging to code, since it was also my first time using the Gin framework and also Uber's absolutely magical dependency injection system Fx, which made me think about Go packages a bit similar to what I'm used to in NestJS. I took heavy inspiration from several other projects and a few videos from awesome people, check out the <a href="#acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</a> section for them! But as usual I've added my own secret spice to the code as well üòâ

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments
Awesome projects and content that helped me figure things out for this little beast of a project!

Useful videos:
* [Trying Another Way... (Dependency Injection)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oosc55SKrM&t=508s)
* [Go Programming ‚Äì Golang Course with Bonus Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo&t=10204s)


A template for clean code using Gin and Fx. Didn't use it for this project as I thought it would be too "overkill" for the scope:
* [Clean Gin](https://github.com/dipeshdulal/clean-gin)


Below are some entries for a back-end contest held back in August here in Brazil that I've studied a lot as well:
* [Leo Vargas' entry](https://github.com/leorcvargas/rinha-go)
* [Isadora Souza's entry](https://github.com/isadoramsouza/rinha-de-backend-go/tree/main)
